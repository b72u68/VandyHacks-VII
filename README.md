# Zoom Chat Monitoring Application

## Project for VandyHacks VII

This app is intended for teachers who use Zoom for their online teaching purposes. 
There are a few functions it can perform: checking for chat participation, flagging
inappropriate language, or searching for chats from a specific student. During this 
time of increased remote classwork, this can be a useful tool for teachers to 
obtain quick stats on their students' involvement in the Zoom classroom, through 
smooth interaction on a user-friendly GUI.


## Usage

	- After concluding a Zoom meeting, download the chat and note the file 
	  location of where it saves. 
	- Open the dist folder.
	- Run the executable to start up the interface. 
		**WARNING: only tested on Windows OS**
	- Choose the option desired. (Please check only one box!)
	- Under "Upload chat log," navigate to the file that contains the Zoom chat.
	- If you would like to provide a custom list of inappropriate words or filter
	  words (those which do not denote meaningful input, like "lol" or "oh"), 
	  attach them under their respective tabs.
	- Click the Start button.
	- Once finished, the output will be written to a .csv file.
